# VideoGame Sales Analysis
Here you'll find a problem simulated by me about a new Game Development company, planning to start a new project. <br>
The company plans to announce and develop a new game, and the project manager wants to get insights from previous games' data, looking for what would likely bring them the best outcome.

This is my first data science project, therefore feel free to leave tips or criticism! <br>
The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales.
